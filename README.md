# E-commerce App with Dashboard, Website, and Mobile App
This project is an e-commerce application that includes a dashboard, website, and mobile app for managing and purchasing products.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides a central location for managing the following:

- User accounts and roles
- Product categories
- Product brands
- Product listings
- Shipping addresses
- Coupons
- Orders
- Analytics
## Website

The website allows customers to:

- Sign in and sign up for an account
- View all products organized by category
- Search for products by category, brand, or name
- Make an order and use a coupon (if available)
- Pay for their order using Stripe
## Mobile App (Flutter)

The mobile app replicates the website's functionality, allowing customers to manage their accounts, browse products, make orders, and pay securely.
